/*
class ===> user defiend type 
struct ===> user defiend type

---> Difference between Struct & Class

- class ==> you can initialize the field
- class ==> Refrence Type (store in heap)
- class ==> you must use new() when instant
- class ==> you can override on constructor
- class ==> constructor can have no parameters 
- class ==> object Name Store in Stack and object store in heap

- struct ==> Value Type (store in stack)
- struct ==> you can't initialize the field
- struct ==> you can't use new() when instant
- struct ==> you cann't override on constructor 
- struct ==> object and object Name Store in Stack
- struct ==> constructor must have parameters in private constructor
